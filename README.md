PROBLEM
In an alien world, computers used are having 32-bit datapaths. However, though we consider the rightmost bit to be the least significant bit and the leftmost bit to the most significant bit in our own world, it is the otherway round in the alien world.

Your task is to write a program that takes a number in the alien world as the input and give the output as interpreted in our own world. You can assume that the numbers are 32-bit unsigned integers.

Input Format

Input number as an integer.

Constraints

--

Output Format

Output number as an integer.

Sample Input

5

Sample Output

2684354560

Explanation

5 is 00000000000000000000000000000101 in binary. When bitwise swapped, it becomes 10100000000000000000000000000000 and hence it is 2684354560.
